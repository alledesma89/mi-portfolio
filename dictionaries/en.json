        "question": "Can you describe your role as Technical Lead at JUBILAME?",
        "answer": "Sure. At JUBILAME my main role was leading a team of 5 developers. Beyond coding with Angular, I handled system architecture, task and sprint management with Jira, and setup of infrastructure on Google Cloud. I also implemented development environments with Docker and supervised testing processes to ensure product quality."
      },
      {
        "question": "What did you contribute to the Erescambio Marketing project?",
        "answer": "As Technical Lead, I led a small team to create an innovative solution. We developed a React application connected to WordPress as a headless CMS, enabling non-technical clients to manage content intuitively and independently."
      },
      {
        "question": "What was your main contribution at AMOVENS?",
        "answer": "At AMOVENS I focused on the frontend with React. I created reusable components and optimized the UI. I was also heavily involved in debugging to improve stability and the overall user experience."
      },
      {
        "question": "Tell me about a difficult technical challenge you solved.",
        "answer": "In one project we faced a critical performance issue in a high-traffic app. After thorough analysis we found a database bottleneck caused by inefficient queries. I led the refactor of queries, introduced a caching layer with Redis, and optimized indexes, reducing response times by about 90%."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you handle technical disagreements within your team?",
        "answer": "I encourage an open, respectful discussion. I listen to all perspectives, request data and proofs of concept to back arguments, and if no clear consensus emerges we decide based on project goals and long-term maintainability. Properly managed disagreements lead to better solutions."
      }
    ],
    "Frontend": [
      {
        "question": "Why would you choose Next.js over plain React for a new project?",
        "answer": "It depends on the project, but I often choose Next.js for built-in optimizations like SSR and SSG that are crucial for SEO and initial performance. Its file-based routing and integrated API routes also speed up full-stack development."
      },
      {
        "question": "What performance optimization strategies do you apply on the frontend?",
        "answer": "I use lazy loading for images and components, apply React.memo and useCallback to avoid unnecessary re-renders, optimize bundle sizes, and ensure images are compressed and in modern formats. I also monitor Core Web Vitals."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's your experience with state management in React?",
        "answer": "I've used Redux for large apps, but recently I prefer Zustand or native hooks (useContext/useReducer) for simpler cases. Zustand is great for its minimal setup and power."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you handle accessibility (a11y) in your projects?",
        "answer": "Accessibility is essential: I use semantic HTML, manage focus correctly, add ARIA attributes when necessary, and ensure sufficient color contrast. I also run audits with tools like Axe during development."
      }
    ],
    "Backend": [
      {
        "question": "Describe your experience building RESTful APIs with Node.js.",
        "answer": "I've designed and built many RESTful APIs with Node.js and Express. I follow best practices: correct HTTP verbs, proper status codes, clear route structure, and input validation with libraries like Joi or Zod."
      },
      {
        "question": "How have you implemented authentication and authorization?",
        "answer": "I've implemented JWT-based authentication flows. The typical flow is: the user logs in, receives a signed token stored securely on the client, and sends it in headers for subsequent requests. For authorization, I use middlewares that verify roles and permissions before allowing access to protected routes."
      },
      {
        "question": "What types of databases have you used?",
        "answer": "I have experience with both SQL and NoSQL databases. I've used PostgreSQL and MySQL for relational needs and MongoDB or Firestore for flexible, scalable use cases. The choice depends on project requirements."
      }
    ],
    "Cloud & DevOps": [
      {
        "question": "Describe your experience with CI/CD.",
        "answer": "I have built CI/CD pipelines using tools like Google Cloud Build and GitHub Actions to automate testing, building, and deployment to staging and production, reducing manual errors and speeding up delivery."
      },
      {
        "question": "What cloud services from AWS or Google Cloud have you used most?",
        "answer": "In Google Cloud I've used Cloud Run and Compute Engine, and Cloud SQL/BigQuery for databases. In AWS I've used EC2, S3 and Lambda for serverless tasks and storage."
      },
      {
        "question": "Explain your experience with Docker.",
        "answer": "I use Docker daily to create consistent development environments. I define services in docker-compose to simplify onboarding and deployments, ensuring reproducible setups across environments."
      }
    ],
    "Education & Growth": [
      {
        "question": "Why are you training in Data Analysis?",
        "answer": "I see data analysis as a natural evolution of my Full-Stack profile. Understanding user behavior through data helps build better products and make strategic development decisions. My goal is to close the loop: build the app, measure impact, and use data to improve it."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you stay updated with new technologies?",
        "answer": "I'm proactive: I follow reference blogs, subscribe to newsletters, take online courses, and apply what I learn in personal projects. The best way to learn is by building."
      },
      {
        "question": "What's the next thing you'd like to learn?",
        "answer": "I'm interested in exploring Microservices architectures and orchestration tools like Kubernetes to build more scalable and resilient applications, complementing my DevOps experience."

    "Personal": [
      {
        "question": "What motivates you to work in tech?",

      },
      {
        "question": "What's a personal project you're proud of?",
        "answer": "I'm building a small app to manage household tasks and expenses. It has allowed me to experiment with new tools like SvelteKit and edge databases and serves as my personal lab."
      },
      {
        "question": "How do you organize to manage multiple tasks?",
        "answer": "I plan my week by breaking big tasks into smaller subtasks, prioritize using the Eisenhower matrix, and use tools like Trello or Notion to keep a clear overview."
